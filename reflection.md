# how it went
## my thoughts
- im very happy with what i made especially looking back on old versions and seeing how far its come,

## did it all work out?
- i did not quite finish everything in my "needs to have" list due to confusion over images taking a long time and a lack of time to figure out sounds in the end.

- even though i didnt finish my needs to have list i think i made up for it by making many intriguing features i didnt think possible for me and really learned a lot and solified my love for coding with this project.

## tips id give my past self
- finish the need to have list first, then add the fun stuff, and have a good time watching the project grow.
